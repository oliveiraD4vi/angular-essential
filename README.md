## Good to know

This project uses [Commitzen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to ensure that git commit messages are formatted in a consistent way.

So you can ignore the package in the root directory.

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your computer.

## How To Use

This project uses [JSONServer](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to simmulate an API and implements the frontend with [Angular](https://angular.io/), so you need to run both applications in order to see it running. 

After cloning the repository, in both backend and frontend directories, use the package manager <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">yarn</a> to install the dependencies with the following

```bash
yarn
```
With the project dependencies properly installed, run

```bash
yarn start
```
Doing that you will have the backend running and can go to the [Frontend](http://localhost/4200) and use the application.
